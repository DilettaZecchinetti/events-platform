# üéüÔ∏è Events Scene App

A full-stack web application that allows staff users to create and manage events, and regular users to sign up and sync them to Google Calendar. The platform integrates the Ticketmaster API to fetch live events.

TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=

MONGO_URI=

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** commit `.env` files to version control. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.


## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Known Limitations
The Add to Calendar feature works on desktop but may not work reliably on mobile browsers due to platform restrictions. Mobile users can still browse and sign up for events but might need to add events to their calendar manually.
